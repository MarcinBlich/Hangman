Hangman for MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS
I would like to be an IT programer, because I am courius about this things. I want to create something useful for people and of course for better tomorrow !! 
I still improve my skills not only about coding ( i am new in this stuff ).

I hope I could join to MOTOROLA's Family.

See you soon
